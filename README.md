# Food Ordering System

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to streamline the interaction between customers and restaurants, improving the online food ordering experience. The platform will enable customers to search for restaurants, browse menus, place orders, and track their deliveries in real-time. For restaurants, it will provide a system to manage orders, assign delivery personnel, and offer live updates on order status. The platform will also integrate delivery management features, including real-time tracking and geolocation data capture, as well as email notifications for user registration, login, and order updates.
